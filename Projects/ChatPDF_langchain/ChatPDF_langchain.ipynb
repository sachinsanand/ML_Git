These services are available at  no cost -\\nshare when obtained by a member covered under  a non -grandfathered plan. This applies to members belonging \\nto individual, small group, large group , and self -insured plans.  There is no copay, deductible or coinsurance, \\neven if the individual or family deductible or out -of-pocket maximum has not been m et as long as the member \\nutilizes a provider in the plan’s network.  \\nPreventive care or preventive medicine refers to measures or services taken to promote health and early \\ndetection/prevention of disease(s) and injuries rather than treating them and/or cu ring them. Preventive care \\nmay include, but are not limited to, examinations and screening tests tailored to an individual’s age, health, and \\nfamily history.  \\nPPACA  does not mandat e that preventive services be c overed at no member cost -share when obtained o ut-of-\\nnetwork.  Members that obtain preventive services out of their network will be subject to copay, deductible, and \\ncoinsurance.  \\n \\nGrandfathered plans are plans that have been in existence prior to March 23, 2010 and are exempt from the \\nrequirement of pro viding preventive services at no member cost share. Grandfathered plans have the \\nopportunity to elect providing coverage of preventive services at no member cost share but  are not required to \\ndo so.  \\nThe USPSTF applies a letter grade for each of the recomme ndations that are released.

There is high \\ncertainty that the net benefit is substantial.  \\nB The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high \\ncertainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is \\nmoderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to \\nsubstantial.  \\nC The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing \\nthis service to individual patients based on professional \\njudgment and patient preferences. There is at least \\nmoderate certainty that the net benefit is small.  \\nD The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is \\nmoderate or high certainty that the service ha s no net \\nbenefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits.   \\nI The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is \\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of \\nthe service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or \\nconflicting, and the balance o f benefits and harms cannot \\nbe determined.  \\n \\nThe ACIP  publishes recommendations on the safe utilization of vaccines.
